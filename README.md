# Chrome ext to Auto Inject Scripts

A simple chrome extension that leverages Google Chrome's Manifest V3 used to inject some of my favourtie scripts while watching YouTube, Netflix.

Provides extra functionalities like:

1. Toggle YouTube sidebar with "[". Not currently in YT.
2. Auto skip intros in Netflix. Who doesn't likes to skip them 🧐.

Planning on to add more functionalities in future.

## How to?

1. Clone the repo
2. Run "npm i" or "npm i --legacy-peer"
3. Run "npm run build"
4. Goto "chrome://extensions" toggle dev mode to on
5. Install extension from "dist/"

Have fun. May be...😎
